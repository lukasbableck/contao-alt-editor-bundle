# contao-alt-editor-bundle

This bundle provides an easy way to see which images do not have an alt text and allows you to add them easily.

<img width="1351" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d92bb12c-4ef3-40b7-a1c0-36074902d01d" />\
 \
Files that are missing an alt text in at least one language are also marked with an icon in the file manager.
